The low side gate drivers each have three smd resitors connected to a PBx and the high side mosfets begin with two resistors connected to a PAx, which confirms the gate driver circuit of the original "Gen1" hoverboard schematics on page 2 of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EFeru/hoverboard-firmware-hack-FOC/main/docs/20150722_hoverboard_sch.pdf

The pins PB15, PB14 and PA8 can easily be tested with a multimeter as they have double holes connecting to the backside layer of the circuit board.
